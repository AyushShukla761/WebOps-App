Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity.

This guide walks through the setup on MacOS, from installing necessary tools to deploying and managing serverless applications.], [Read more posts by this author.], [As we progress in the age of digital transformation, organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework, an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda, is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management, which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless, and how does it function? In this blog, we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.], [The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers, making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.], [Before we start with the Serverless framework, we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.], [To install Node.js, we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:], [brew install node], [For Python, MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However, it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:], [brew install python], [To verify successful installation, type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.], [After installing Node.js and Python, it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:], [npm i -g serverless], [Upon installation, verify the version using serverless -v command.], [To deploy your functions on AWS, you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command, replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:], [serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin], [To create a new service or function, use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example, to create a Python service:], [sls create --template aws-python --path myService], [To deploy this function to AWS, use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only, use sls deploy function -f functionName.], [To test a function on AWS, use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.], [AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings.], [To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS, first, install the AWS CLI:], [brew install awscli], [Next, install AWS SAM:], [brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli], [Initialize a new SAM application using sam init, choose your desired runtime (e.g., Python), and template. To build your application, navigate to the project directory and use sam build.], [You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API, you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.], [To deploy your application, use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke ""FunctionName"".], [If you need to delete your stack for any reason, you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.], [You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode, click on ""Add Debug Configuration"" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.], [For Python packages management, you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.], [As you can see, the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating, deploying, and managing serverless applications. Moreover, by leveraging these tools, we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.], [Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage, it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions, which leads to significant cost savings, especially for applications with variable workloads.], [We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.], [Get the latest posts delivered right to your inbox], [A problem, framework, budget, library, language agnostic approach to ML], [A journey of impacting 2000+ students in 365 days, 40+ projects, a 20 member insane team and 1 fricking vision], [Stay up to date!

HuggingSage,22 OCT 2023,,"[Using Amazon Sagemaker to deploy whichever Hugging Face models you want, along with API inference], [Read more posts by this author.], [Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog, we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named ""Llama2"" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.], [Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here, create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.], [After setting up your domain and user, head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the ""Sagemaker Jumpstart"" section, and from there, choose to deploy the ""llama 7b model."" This process usually takes about seven minutes, and at the end of it, you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this, as it will be essential for the next steps.], [Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options, you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how], [We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.], [Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker, we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend, session, region, and version. You can find the available versions here], [Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B, 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.], [Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.], [Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning, e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.], [These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B, 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks, we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances, since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.], [It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.], [To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id, instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type, which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.], [Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.], [After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:], [You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation], [The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:], [[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>], [{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]], [We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt, which converts a List of ""messages"" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.], [Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.], [With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand, navigate to AWS Lambda. Here, create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:], [For your Lambda function to work correctly, it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions, create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:], [Once your function is ready and permissions are in place, expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.], [To test the setup, use a curl command, like the one below:], [This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function, which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.], [Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process.

In this blog, we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.], [Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog], [It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section, I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead, I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!], [The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data, identifying potential outliers, and understanding the relationship between different variables.], [Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning, normalization, and standardization of values.], [When dealing with large datasets, it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as ""batches"". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor, and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.], [Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A ""baseline"" is a relatively simple, existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress, you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.], [Once you have decided on your model, the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function, optimizer, and the evaluation metrics. After compiling, fit your model to the training data, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.], [After your model has been fitted, it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.], [In order to improve the model's performance, you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.], [Remember, overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting, consider using techniques such as data augmentation, regularization layers, or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.], [The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.], [Once you have beaten your baseline, you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model, training for a longer period, finding an ideal learning rate, using more data, or using transfer learning.], [The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.], [Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it, thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data, where actions such as rotating, flipping, and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.], [Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset, such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training, consider shuffling your data.], [When processing your data, you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:], [Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.], [Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:], [Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, based on your project's requirements.], [Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems, evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.], [Apart from that, a good way to proceed is visualize, visualize, visualize!], [It's a good idea to visualize], [To visualize our model's predictions, it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values], [To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations, it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.], [Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....], [Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation, compilation, and training stages.], [During the model creation stage, you might add more layers, increase the number of hidden units in each layer, or change the activation function. In the compilation stage, changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.], [This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as ""hyperparameter tuning"".], [Approaches to improve accuracy], [Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment, like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow, depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch, the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().], [Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function, where device is set to ""cuda"" for GPU or ""cpu"" for the Central Processing Unit.], [In conclusion, understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively.

These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.], [In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi, back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.], [In this article, we will talk about this methodology's history, applications, and best practices. Furthermore, I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations.

To get a ballpark figure, we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require, if not one.

This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.], [Whenever we try to learn something new, we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly, when beginning system design estimations, we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers, used for estimating the speed of a system, are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency, as a term, helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example, the latency of the best video chat applications, such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.], [Before approximating the real utilization, we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance, we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.], [How can we guess the real usage?], [The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and, if necessary, further divided) and combined.], [For instance, we might anticipate 1K active users, each of whom submits 15 requests daily.], [15K requests per day, or 15K/86400 requests per second, are involved.], [An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly.

You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start, but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?], [Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance, serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU, whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM.

The best way to understand it is this - You are at a restaurant as a ""client"". You ask the waiter for something ""spicy"". The waiter understands what you said and relays this ""request"" to the chef.

Say my dataset is the collection of characteristics of ""houses in London"" & their prices], [Basically, our learning algorithm (especially in supervised learning) mostly is always assigning the right values to these weights associated with each value, to come up with a function (aka ""hypotheses function"") that always gives the good predicted value.
Eg : water supply hours should be given a higher weightage compared to other features, since most people want that, hence such houses will be in high demand, hence the prices for these houses will be more], [Regression Multivariate Gradient Descent Normalization Regularization], [Used when - We have a labelled dataset & we wish to devise a function that uses the features + parameters & predicts the most accurate output. Since, the results are continuous & not into classified buckets, hence, the term ""regression"".], [Eg application - Guessing the price of a house, starting with a labelled dataset of various houses‚Äô features such as area, locality etc. & their actual prices], [""linear"", since we mostly only deal with features independent of each other. Eg : size of a house does not ideally depend directly on how near its location is to a school.

Get it just right :)], [Lastly, we can also use something called ""Stochastic Gradient Descent"" for improving our hypotheses function, in case our dataset is too large & iterating over all training examples for each step of gradient descent is too time & compute consuming
This approach looks at only 1 random training example in each iteration of gradient descent, as opposed to all examples in the training set, & improves parameters just for that 1 example in that step, before moving on to the next random example in the next step.

The most interesting kind of workplace I could possibly ask for.], [My first introductions to the company started with a LinkedIn post announcing for hiring a React Developer Intern. I was lucky to be tagged onto it by a friend.
As researched more about the people, I got amazed more and more about how 3 extraordinarily talented people, from different walks of life, had gotten together on an idea and stood by it, since 2018 (3 years back), against all odds.], [I even went through one of their blogs on why something like this had to be done.], [The more I researched, the more I was convinced that the problem, the idea, the people and the approach all seemed to somehow fit perfectly into actually solving one of the biggest problems of the 21st century.

In those 30 minutes I actually experienced the diversity in thoughts and approach of Aman Bhaiya and Nikhil Bhaiya.

After a short answer, Aman Bhaiya realised that they hadn't introduced themselves to me yet so after about 5 minutes of awkward questioning, I hear - ""Hi ! I'm Aman, and these are my co-founders Nikhil and Kaishu (who was wired into code, and just greeted me with a classic ‚úå).""], [Post-interview, one thing was for sure though.

The path I was expected to tread was one of a Masters from a college of repute, a high-paying engineering job at a tech giant and a settled life. So, a startup was a big red flag on this road. And upto this point, these were the exact footsteps I'd been taking.], [But this time, I somehow gathered enough confidence to go against my family and explore this uncharted territory, purely because my heart knew this was the place I had to be in.

Nikhil Bhaiya was getting teased about flexing his AirPods on call. Kaishu Bhaiya walked up from behind, sipping a chocolate smoothie. Hemil, the Flutter Developer intern was being laughed at, for turning his camera on for the 1st time on call. Arun Bhaiya, the graphic designer, smiled, not understanding most of what we were saying as we spoke in Hindi, a language that was not-native to the South Indian origins he hails from. ¬†Ankita Didi was laughing, complaining about being detained at Khosla House (I think it's a guest house) back in IIT Roorkee, where she was balancing her dissertation side by side with a graphic designing internship at Farmako.], [I remember laughing a lot without realizing at how this strangely messed up medley of people would become family to me in the upcoming weeks, and how we would embark upon a great journey on revitalizing the healthcare situation in India.

I remember texting Nikhil Bhaiya at 4:30 in the morning (my first Slack message) inquiring whether the cab rates were actually this high or if I was being duped.], [I reach by 6 and that's when I learnt my first lesson, a lesson in patience. For over an hour I kept ringing the office's doorbell respectfully, and no one answered. I started to worry if this was some messed up prank or worse, as my mother feared, a setup with a nefarious ulterior motive.
Fun fact : My mother actually thought that this company was a front to terrorist activities and I would be kidnapped and transported via boat to some cell which was why I had been called alone to an Goa.], [Locks clicked and I came face to face with a barely awake, well-built, baby faced guy, wearing a plain grey t-shirt, boxers and a ""what the heck's going on ?"" look. Kaishu Sahu, CTO, Farmako. I remember thinking ""He looks barely a year older than me !"". After an awkward exchange of introductions, we stepped into the most messed up apartment ever I had ever seen in my life.

To call it unclean would be undermining the degree to which this place had been trashed. The dining table was cluttered with uncountable meals of food and unwashed plates, giving the apartment what it's unique ¬†smell . The office space and tables were littered with soda cans, Dorito bits, used tissue papers, wires and spilled drinks. There was even a hole in the wall for some reason and a dark circular spot on the ceiling (some in-house cricket tragedy I guessed). ¬†
Every other breathing space was sucked up by electronics, wires, routers, multiple testing mobile devices, a broken printer, a destroyed microwave, large whiteboards scribbled with product ideas and printouts (credits : Nikhil Bhaiya) of pop-singers and trending memes ¬†
I think the maid had clearly given up by this point. A door handle had been broken, kitchen cabinet doors had unhinged, fridge was packed with food that was no longer edible (1 open beer dated 6 months), and there were scattered piles of groceries, spices and massive amounts of some body building protein mix (credits : Kaishu Bhaiya)], [""It's just 1 month"", I breathed as I picked the guitar, something that always calmed my nerves. It had stickers of the company logo and Y Combinator's logo on it. I shared a quality conversation and a plate of rice-cakes with Kaishu Bhaiya. We talked about college life, programming journey, interests, ideas and the history of the company. I'd totally fund the guy too ! The amount of technical knowledge he possessed was a lot more than most other people I'd met in life. Funnily, that's where most his expertise ended too. As I saw him hesitantly wash the dishes, I could guess that this was definitely a rare occasion.], [I crashed on the couch for about 2 hours. I woke up to the smell of chicken that the cook was preparing. Being a vegetarian, I recoiled and I looked around to find a friendly, spectacled, bearded face grinning broadly at me. Aman Bhandula, CEO, Farmako Healthcare.
We exchanged introductions, jammed over the guitar and then entered Kaishu Bhaiya's room to wake up the lean dead body sleeping on a mattress beside the bed; AirPods plugged in, bedsheet from chin to toe, dead-asleep after what I guessed must've been a stretched out code-tear. Nikhil Kumar, Technical Lead, Farmako Healthcare. He greeted me with a slight nod and a ‚úåÔ∏è and went back to sleep again.], [I onboarded the website and web application project that evening. Aman Bhaiya was leaving the next day for a last rafting adventure with his college friends, so that evening, we shared a bowl of Maggi and an amazing conversation about entrepreneurship, networking, morals and how Farmako went from being a barely surviving project out of Aman Bhaiya's hostel room, where they had to save up to purchase 1 printer, to the rocketship startup it had become 2.5 years later.], [""They're great people, but I'm just an intern."" - I said to myself as I lay down to sleep, planning on quitting after a month of programming, Goa and learning the inner workings of a startup. ¬†I was going to be proven wrong.......big time.], [A classic morning at office started with me waking up to enjoy a walk nearby and then a quick cereal breakfast. Some college and programming work would follow. The cleaning helper, Nikita Didi, showed up at 9 and we shared light conversation. I'd cleaned most of the apartment a day after onboarding so even she felt happy to go the extra mile in wrapping up the rest of the trash. She was the unofficial tour guide who taught me a lot ranging from how to identify ripe fruits to finding a watch repair shop around.], [The Hackers would wake up by afternoon, mostly after the cook showed up. They were in a separate league of their own. Based off of Paul Graham's interpretation of people, given a chance to choose between being a hacker or a painter, I'd definitely go for the former. It feels like a complex personality on the outside, but on the inside, it's just an innocent, inquisitive, relentless child, with a yearning to build something great.], [Hackers are actually the most interesting people. They're a beautiful combination of contrary idealogies. They'll know how to tackle some of the most complex problems but have difficulties overcoming basic obstacles in life.
Kaishu and Nikhil Bhaiya are pure hackers by soul. They learn and implement new technologies at breakneck speed but take hours to decide what to order for dinner. They trust revealing their identity to no one online and have the most complex authentication setup on their machines, but throw the apartment keys on the floor. They claimed to be busy with new ideas all the time but they also managed to find time to install Linux OS on my PC (three times over, at this point). They have their socially awkward moments with the people around, but not a day went by when they failed to ask whether I'd eaten enough. They keep arguing on countless occasions, blaming each other for bugs, but somehow reconcile and deep down, even though they never acknowledge it face-to-face, carry great respect each other.
They can't express it, but they do care.], [And I just don't mean the word ""hacker"" in the computer programming fashion. These fighters can hack any problem. On a classic weekend, you'd see Nikhil Bhaiya rewiring the WiFi connection in the office by hand or Kaishu Bhaiya dismantling electric sockets to fit iOT devices to automate lights and fans via voice recognition. They're your classic open-it-up-and-see-how-it-works engineers.

And then you'd find these same people microwave frozen Coke bottles or descending on an ascending elevator or speeding past cops when asked to pull over. (we came close to an arrest twice)], [The more I got to know about them, the more I learnt, not just about the tech stack we were using or the brilliant system architecture they'd designed, but about how to bravely explore a new idea, get version 1 out quickly and keep punching at the problem, with undying hope for a breakthrough. Pure entrepreneurs. Relentlessly resourceful (as Sam Altman would say).], [Launch, Inspect, Iterate, Repeat. Pretty inspiring, if you ask me.], [I was on a work-ethic path that would have eventually killed me at some point. I didn't even realise this since I always felt pretty cool about learning some new skill instead of spending some time with friends and family or even exploring and experiencing new avenues. Even if I'd spare 5 minutes, I'd run off to pursue some new programming skill. This wasn't sustainable. I was clearly missing out on a lot and not even understanding how important it all was. I was running away from a truth but all this would have eventually led to nowhere.], [Nikhil Bhaiya has a way to extract what he wants to know from you, no matter how hard you try to hide it. Friggin hacker. It seemed intrusive at first but later it did feel nice to share problems with someone as uptil then, I've a habit of playing it all pretty close to the chest.
He gave me an hour long advice on why it was actually really easy to always be busy with work in life, the hard part was gratefully acknowledging all the people who stood beside you and giving them time too.], [He'd snatch me off to trips to nearby forts, cafes, ice-cream parlours, beaches and slowly I began to comprehend, the depth of why however stupid it seemed, it was really important to go off-plan and try something new out. If you ask Kaishu Bhaiya his biggest regret in college life, he'd tell you he wished he'd learnt the guitar. Nikhil Bhaiya wishes he'd spent time on learning some non-technical skill too.], [It was a great couple of days, beginning to understand and learn from these unlikely mentors on what life actually seems like, out of college, in the real world.], [I learnt how to drive a scooter, the 1st time at 2am outside Anjuna Fort, Goa, on Nikhil Bhaiya's relentless persuasion. He kept joking about kidnapping me. Once when the electricity went out, the 3 of us spent an afternoon pencil-carving and the evening, programming out of a KFC fast-food joint.
We'd go to Artjuna Cafe, 20 kms away, to code, mainly because Nikhil Bhaiya really liked the cheesecake there. Or say drop by Gai Kajus, a cashew nut factory that was Kaishu Bhaiya's #1 spot to kick back with a class of dry-fruit milk.], [I spent a lot of time with Nikhil Bhaiya, since he was who I was mainly interning under. The lean, spectacled, piercing eyed hacker has a kind of Megamind like vibe. He knows all the hacks and glitches of the game, but chose to stay more on the good side. As Aman Bhaiya says, he's an ocean of knowledge, and just from talking to him, you learn a lot, although it does get overwhelming after a point as he just won't stop talking. He's different from everyone I know. He'd kick back with a Coke at 6AM, sleep till 3PM and blazingly ship code afterward till the next 6AM shot of caffeine. Funny thing is, from his attitude it looks like he's laid-back, but has the most control over his mind and time, always slamming deadlines. ¬†], [We used to get lost couple of times near beaches, scrambling to find our scooter. He'll still always blame me for the first time when we went on one of these walks and by mistake my hand knocked out his iPhone from his, resulting in a scratch.

He has infinite hunger to learn something new and build something cool with it. And boy does he always manage to surprise.
He mostly keeps to himself and is always worried about something all the time. It may ranges from anything like a new bug to not getting a credit card approval from some bank. You'll never see him anywhere without a backpack containing his laptop, strapped to his back.
The craziest adventure we shared was an unfruitful 3 hour, 50 km drive across Goa to purchase guitar strings, everytime being redirected to a closed shop or even in one case, a private bar (thanks Google Maps !) for some reason.

Like I said, being vegetarian, I took time to get used to the smell of chicken in the apartment. I remember feeling left out when they went to the gym.

Kaishu Bhaiya always claimed eating less food so it did bug me when he stole food we'd bring( later, Nikhil Bhaiya and I ¬†secretly just bought extras :) ). Working with Nikhil Bhaiya also requires some next level dedication since he'll continuously keep barraging questions and thoughts whilst you try to concentrate and code. Also, it took infinite amount of patience to keep the office clean and organized and regulate food wastage.
But they were worth it. All of it. ¬†I just wished I'd told all of this to them much sooner as it got sorted really quickly when we discussed it later.

It just hit me that organized information of courses in their true nature - as being linked entities was much required owing to 2 reasons :], [I read ""The Mom Test"" as my reference (because Eric said so......) & interviewed around 40 people in total, mainly from my college], [Hence, was born the idea for a platform that would treat each course as a node in a graph to begin with, and build on top of this presumption to eventually proceed towards better networks between students, professors & projects.], [It was a problem I said I would solve by providing structured information - the only flaw in the plan - I didn't even have unstructured information to begin withüòÜ], [I remember that the first approach I had was interviewing people, asking them to share their course details, then scribbling that in a notebook, going on academic.iitm.ac.in, & actually then manually relating courses to one another in my own notion db], [What seemed like a stupid idea, kept me going strong to setup a backend, come up with a simple way to interact with Notion's API & support the entire architecture just on the presumption that more interviews would mean more courses being actually manually added in the Notion DB, so I could bootstrap the MVP with a simple 150 courses to begin with.], [So with that, I set out with a 1.5 month product journey, starting in February, with a launch date set for 8th March.

The Hackers had taught me better.
Yet like always, I did manage to screw up. I called cab to the wrong pickup point, gave the wrong destination and after about 3 hours and ‚Çπ1500 down, I finally found the office space (Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India). A couple of painters and workers were doing some renovation work. I got into an argument with one when I claimed I'd come to stay, but he wouldn't listen saying this villa had already been booked and I couldn't get it.], [Hearing this commotion, one of the people inside walked out.

This phase speaks more about building a home and creating an environment where team members would feel excited to work on something cool.], [A lot of the initial days mostly involved setting up equipment. Initially, it was just me and Aman Bhaiya. We ate off of a simple picnic setup of takeaways and towel-tablecloths. We oversaw delivery, management and setup of common household and office equipment.], [Aman Bhaiya is what Kaishu Bhaiya jokingly calls a ""hackist"" - combination of a hacker and an artist. Nikhil Bhaiya will just tease him about dropping out and currently doing managerial and design work, basically non-programming work (""Alt + Click is barely any work"" ~Nikhil Kumar).
I personally think he's a great leader, honest friend and most important - a good person. Like the Hackers, he carries his unique entrepreneurial spark coupled with a clear vision, an extremely high pain and patience index and a great heart, fair to everyone.], [Case in point : Aman Bhandula won't care about wearing the same design T Shirt (classic black Van Heusen) everyday (hacker) but he will be super skeptical about tiny details such as the font size or the padding when it comes to UI of the website (artist) or say something like the accuracy of the Machine Learning voice recognition model he trained for the SaaS product for doctors.], [A week later, Kaishu and Nikhil Bhaiya also showed up from Goa after a series of comic incidents on fighting with packers and movers and a small funny scooter accident to cap it off. To this day, you'll hear Nikhil Bhaiya chuckle - ""I always knew travelling with Sahu would someday end in an accident"".], [Building a culture starts from the place you're expected to do your best work. A lot of thought had been put into the entire setup, right from the principles hung up in the conference room to the design of the bean bags in the break room.
We'd be moving around all day - heaving around things, installing equipment, wiring up an efficient internet connection, ¬†mounting bookshelves and a lot more. I still remember the day the work tables and office chairs showed up and the amount of effort and dis-assembling and re-assembling it took to get this massive conference table through a small door.], [Post attending my online college lectures during the day (which earned me the reputation of school kid) ¬†I'd return to code by late afternoon. I'd get my tasklist from Aman Bhaiya and start shipping code. In late evening, we'd take a small break and play squash, then dinner and then back to ideating on the whiteboard and shipping some more code.

We majorly drank juices and soda for about the first 10 days, since due to some packers & movers issue, our water purifier's delivery was messed up. So barely drank water, and at one point Nikhil Bhaiya got so frustrated that at 11:30 he used the a food delivery service to simply order 3 bottles of water. Another story involved me breaking into farm house from a neighboring villa after locking us out. There's also the incident of me and Aman Bhaiya almost setting fire in the lawn as we tried to barbecue food using wood shards, instead of coal (talk about learning thermodynamics), as fuel. ¬† ¬†], [We even visited Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, the college which brought the founders together, birthplace of Farmako. I had a blast glimpsing into their life, sharing their friends, dreams and memories. Kaishu Bhaiya completed the promise he'd made to clean his room once they got accepted into Y Combinator. Aman Bhaiya met old friends and relived nostalgic moments. Cool things I did involved breaking a lock , playing the guitar on a rooftop and slipping into the library or any-place on campus, posing as a student the entire time.], [Around this time, I met Ankita Didi, this brilliant, cheery graphic designer in the team, who'd masterminded a lot of the UI/UX work at Farmako whilst simultaneously pursuing her dissertation in engineering. Ankita Didi is the artist in the team. She possesses a natural inner compass of figuring out what looks cool and constitutes great design, kind of like her own crazy Spidey-Sense.
Apart from that, she's this badass elder sister who'll keep advising on following rules and taking care of health, but will joyfully accompany expeditions on doing something crazy, out of bounds (stealing a miniature sauce pan as a memento from her favorite restaurant or trespassing on the most well-kept, off-limits gardens of IIT Roorkee). All things said, she carries a pure heart, sheer willingness to learn, explore and adapt quickly and a dream to build something of her own.], [It's just crazy and fitting how this team came together. Birds of a feather.], [An unsettling worm was eating me on the inside. I'll admit thinking really selfishly about personal growth at that time. So, as much as I enjoyed it, I wanted all of this amazing programming work, minus the other interactions. Seems crazy now, but at that point all I thought was - ""What do I get from this ?"". Hence, at several points, I thought of quitting and even came real close this one time when under the pressure of backlogged academics and other commitments, I was about the book a flight that very evening and leave all of this behind. Harsh ? I know.], [Aman Bhaiya made it very clear that working remotely wouldn't work out hence I had decided to call it quits.
Rationally that would have been a proper decision. But I decided to trust my instinct on this one. Sometimes, you just can't leave people, that's what made me stick and give it 1 final shot. One of my best life choices ever. ¬†A lot of qualities I carry as a person today, stem from that one moment of choosing to stick with the idea and the people I'd fallen in love with.], [
Also, funny story, the same night, a burglar broke into my parent's house from the balcony where I usually code during the same time. Boy would alternate-universe-me have gotten into deep trouble that night had I quit and returned home], [Cool office ? Check. Insanely passionate team ? Check. Brilliant product vision ? Check. Time to make something people want. And it did go brilliantly. The website was launched, the web app was in final UI stages, the mobile app was gaining users. We were exploring new UI development lifecycle technologies and considering a database migration to a more graph oriented approach with Neo4j], [Nikhil Bhaiya was working on the automation of SMS sending and Whatsapp business status. Kaishu Bhaiya was iterating on the mobile app, installing Indian fonts on a receipt machine and some miscellaneous backend work. Aman Bhaiya was coordinating with the setup of our medical store, co-designing UI and company standees with Ankita Didi; managing product, personnel, onboardings and planning the next steps for scaling up the company during summer. I was working on the website's SEO and social-media-bot-tagging, along with design reiterations using valuable feedback from my co-intern Hardik. On free days, I'd accompany Aman Bhaiya on product pitches to nearby laboratories and clinics. Funnily, I was the only person in the team with a driving license and experience for quite some time.], [Farmhouse bustled with activity. You could hear Aman Bhaiya on his calls from the conference room, roll your chair over and you'd find Nikhil Bhaiya cursing at some existing software service or API and how he'd one day replace it with his own. I feared that someday, the hacker actually might. Kaishu Bhaiya was quiet most of the time. He'd write some code, walk around to debug some issue, think of product features and then speak little to us about our progress.], [Food at a startup is the one thing that is always a great experience, across all startups. After a stressful day, we'd dig into great takeout food, share stories and mock each other the entire time. Kaishu Bhaiya is super into fitness so we'd joke about how he ate dinner by the calorie, only to later gorge on the stocked food as ""midnight snacks"". Nikhil Bhaiya is super into non-veg so he'd be happy with his own special meal. Aman Bhaiya and I were just too hungry to care. ¬†], [What I enjoyed most, were the late night walks we went on, in the society, freely talking about problems, dreams, opinions and feelings. Even the aggressive dogs, swarm of mosquitos and impending time pressure would fade away for some time as 4 engineers from different walks of life rediscovered a different kind of family in each other.], [Which was a good thing, since what followed would shake us to our core ¬†], [Good things fall apart. Good people don't though.], [It all started falling out of hand beginning with when Aman Bhaiya had to urgently leave, since his family was not doing great, health-wise. Kaishu Bhaiya left a couple days after. Same reason. Ankita Didi was quarantined back in IIT Roorkee. Nikhil Bhaiya and I spent around 5 days before he too had to leave due to some medical emergency in the family. Just all of a sudden, the pandemic had knocked out our breath. What once was a home, buzzing with constant ideas, products and energy felt like an empty vessel of nothingness.], [Programming suddenly felt dry. Most things in life did. I couldn't tell the founders this since they were struggling with their own problems and worrying about me would burden them further. So I'd call up Ankita Didi. Her crazy energy would make me forget about most problems and worries about the founders' families. We'd come up with stupid challenges to co-learn new software platforms for UI designing and then laugh by trashing each other's work.
Nikhil and Aman Bhaiya sometimes called and we'd laugh together as they said - ""You thought this was going a programming internship......""], [Things came around for a short period when Madhvendra Singh, (aka Madhu Bhaiya) joined. The founders' families were recovering at great rates and living with Madhu Bhaiya is also real fun.
Madhu Bhaiya is the typical I-know-people-and-get-shit-done kind of guy. He rocks a classic gold chain and hearty laugh. He's the go to person to discuss when you screw up something really bad. Also he's a a good people-reader and daring risk-taker. We shared a great couple of days of guitar jamming, barbecuing and working on the recruitment of new hires for the summer.], [Aman Bhaiya showed up soon after, with his family, having rented 2 more villas in the same society. ¬†He'd lost a lot of weight but still managed to pull of his classic energetic, confident, ever-black-Van-Heusen T-shirt-wearing personality. For a brief moment things seemed to stabilize after this long overhaul. And then everything spiraled out of control.], [The same night, one after another, 2 medical emergencies struck our team. This time, both cases, it was critical. I scrambled around at both ends to help neutralize the emergencies.], [It involved a lot of inter-city driving at odd hours, rushing to places to fetch medicines and reports, continuously being on call to arrange for some sort of solution or another, barely catching up on sleep and being constantly worried all the time. Madhu Bhaiya was facing the same situation. Nikhil and Kaishu Bhaiya were COVID positive and barely supporting themselves and their families. Aman Bhaiya and his sister, pushed their pain index to another level, hardly eating or sleeping, working round the clock.], [The worst part about this crisis is we lost to it. I remember breaking down uncontrollably at a 6AM quiet morning at farm house. Helplessness, guilt and regret engulfed me. I doubt it'll leave. Sometimes even the thought of it sucks the breath out of me.], [The following day, my grandfather and the day after, my aunt, both were hospitalized in Mumbai. Every family I've cared about was crumbling.], [I boarded the flight to Mumbai, wearing a stuffy PPE kit and a really fogged mind about when things would get better.
